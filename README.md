# RecyclingMessaging

This repo is a learning environment focused on sentiment analysis of recycling messaging text.

## Project 1: Sentiment analysis of tweets from @NYCzerowaste and  @NYCSanitation
1. Positive words vs. Negative words
    - Create Twitter app
    - Access tweets with Tweepy
    - Regex to clean tweets prior to sentiment analysis
    - Use textblob to classify tweets by sentiment
        - Assess words for trash-related content, and remove it.

### NOTES:
- 'en-sentiments.xml' is the source of word valences
- Can try swapping out analyzer for NLTK module
    #### Limitations:
    - A B C
